*Created by Kyle Ireton on June 29th, 2022*

This is for Connor to use the necessary pipelines for transforming raw data into visualizations and analysis


**1. Data Processing Pipeline**

  This converts raw data .csv's into one master processed data .csv which can be analyzed
  
**2. Progress Pipeline**

  This is a quick visualization process to track progress within and between stages, to keep track of promotions and graduation
  
**3. Visualization Pipeline**

  This generates figure-form visualizations and statistical analyses for use when it comes time to publish.
